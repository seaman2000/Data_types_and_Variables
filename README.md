## Tasks Overview

### ☑️ 1.	concat_names.py
Write a program that reads two names and a delimiter. It should print the names joined by the delimiter.

### Example
**Input:**
```
Jan
White
<->
```
**Output:**
```
Jan<->White
```
### ☑️ 2.	convert_meters_to_kilometers.py
You will be given an integer that represents a distance in meters. Write a program that converts meters to kilometers, formatted to the second decimal point.

### Example
**Input:**
```
2656
```
**Output:**
```
2.66
```
### ☑️ 3.	pounds_to_dollars.py
Write a program that converts British pounds (integer) to US dollars formatted to the 3rd decimal point.
1 British Pound = 1.31 Dollars.

### Example
**Input:**
```
65
```
**Output:**
```
85.50
```

### ☑️ 4.	centuries_to_minutes.py
Write a program that reads an integer number of centuries and converts it to years, days, hours, and minutes.  
*Assume that one year has 365.2422 days on average (the Tropical year).*

### Example
**Input:**
```
2
```
**Output:**
```
2 centuries = 200 years = 73048 days = 1753152 hours = 105189120 minutes
```
### ☑️ 5.	special_numbers.py
Write a program that reads an integer n. Then, for all numbers in the range [1, n], print the number and if it is special or not (True / False).  
  A number is special when the sum of its digits is 5, 7, or 11.

### Example
**Input:**
```
6
```
**Output:**
```
1 -> False
2 -> False
3 -> False
4 -> False
5 -> True
6 -> False
```
### ☑️ 6.	next_happy_year.py
You are saying goodbye to your best friend: "See you next happy year". Happy Year is the year with only distinct digits, for example, 2018. Write a program that receives an integer number and finds the next happy year.

### Example
**Input:**
```
8989
```
**Output:**
```
9012
```
